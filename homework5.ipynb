    "We will learn about the basics of gene expression data analysis. Biologists have found a way to measure how much each gene is *expressed* in each cell in an experiment. We do this by counting the number of mRNA molecules in each cell. Remember, DNA holds instructions for building proteins but can't be turned into proteins directly. Translation of DNA creates mRNA molecules which ribosomes read to synthesize proteins.\n",

    "## Problem 1: Constructing the count matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Each single-cell gene-expression experiment takes a tissue sample containing many cells. We want to measure the amount of mRNA from a particular gene for each of those cells. We create a *gene-expression matrix*, where the rows correspond to individual cells, and the columns correspond to individual genes. So, our output will be an $N$ by $G$ matrix where $N$ is the number of cells, and $G$ is the number of genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of cells forming a tissue must undergo special treatment before we can put it into a sequence. For instance, if we were to take all the cells, gather their mRNA material, and put this into a sequencer, we wouldn't be able to match mRNA molecules with their cell of origin. Therefore, we must attach a *cell barcode* to each cell. This barcode will be attached to all the mRNA reads coming from this cell. We will use this barcode to match mRNA molecules with their cell. The sequencer also needs to know which molecules to sequence. We only want it to sequence mRNA molecules and nothing else. Therefore, we use a special molecular primer that binds to the poly-A tail of mRNA molecules. Don't worry if you don't understand this, because it isn't crucial to us. The important thing is that each read comes with three pieces. First is the cell barcode, then the molecular primer, and then the actual mRNA fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 12 bases of each read are the cell barcode. The following 24 bases are the oligo-dT primer, which we will discard since it carries no information. The remaining bases are the actual mRNA fragment of the gene of interest. You can find a more realistic schematic [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/archive/2022-02-01/topics/transcriptomics/images/celseq2_schema.svg). If you want to find out more about this, [this tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-umis/tutorial.html) seems informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[TASK]**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared a collection of reads (`data/reads.fastq`) in a FASTQ file containing Phred quality scores for each nucleotide (this comes from the sequencer). We will ignore these scores in this homework. You can easily read these files using Biopython.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to take each read and determine which gene and cell it corresponds to. The reads come from SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue, so we'll be interested in which cells SARS-CoV-2 genes are expressed. We won't use NCBI for SARS-CoV-2 gene annotations this time, but we will use a more standard approach. Two files are necessary: `data/sars-cov-2.fa` is a fasta file containing the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome, and `genes.gff` contains the gene annotations in GFF format. You must use these files in this homework, as we have removed some genes to make the exercise easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each read in `reads.fasq`, you must extract the cell barcode and mRNA fragment (and drop the primer). Because sequencers make mistakes and introduce errors, we'll have to run local alignment to align the fragment to each SARS-CoV-2 gene and determine the origin. For alignment, you can either adapt your implementation from HW2 or use the [`pairwise2`](https://biopython.org/docs/1.76/api/Bio.pairwise2.html) module from Biopython.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you align a fragment, determine the gene region of this mRNA fragment. For instance, if we have gene XYZ ranging from positions 250 to 1250 on the reference genome, a fragment that maps into this region, e.g., 450-600, can be considered an expression of this gene. Since we are constructing a count matrix, we are just counting the fragments. For instance, if the barcode is AAACCCTTT and we've mapped the read to gene XZY, we'd increase the cell in our count matrix at row AAACCCTTT and column XZY by +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more important thing we must account for is possible contamination. If the tissue sample contains contamination with cells from other organisms, we might get reads that map insufficiently to our reference genome. To circumvent this, we will apply a simple threshold to our aligned reads. We will calculate the Hamming similarity of the alignments and only keep the reads that map to our reference genome with a similarity of 0.95 or higher. The Hamming similarity is just Hamming distance but counting matches instead of mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement four functions: `split_read`, `map_read_to_gene`, `generate_count_matrix`, and `filter_matrix` in `helper_functions.py`. Each function is worth an equal number of points. Please go through the docstrings for implementation details. Once you've implemented these functions, create a count matrix from the reads provided in `data/reads.fastq`.\n",

We also won't have to find the reverse complement of the mRNA fragment; you can take each sequence as is and align it to the reference genome. Finally, we will assume that the cell barcodes contain no sequencing errors; sequencing errors are limited to the mRNA portion of each read."

    "\n",
    "In the previous problem, we learned how to create count matrices and the meaning of the numbers inside them. However, this scenario is unrealistically small. In the real world, single-cell RNA-sequencing runs produce millions of reads, which we must map to the genome. There are also intronic regions to consider, which can further complicate our lives. Fortunately, researchers have already implemented these algorithms and created well-established pipelines that go through this entire process for us. For instance, RNA sequence alignment is usually done using the STAR aligner or bowtie2 (in case you ever run across these in the wild).\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes no sense to align reads to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. After all, the goal of the virus is to replicate, and that's its only job. Even if we sequence infected cells and look at reads aligning to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we will get little diversity because -- most likely -- we'll see that all the genes are expressed all the time. It would be much more interesting instead to see the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on a host organism. Human cells are much more diverse, as they have to perform various tasks. They achieve this by activating different sets of genes, all of which we can measure using single-cell RNA sequencing. Then, if we know which cells come from a healthy person and which cells come from an infected person, we can compare how SARS-CoV-2 impacts the gene programs that usually run inside the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at a real-world count matrix containing this data. Count matrices are often readily available in public repositories, e.g., NCBI GEO. We've provided you with a count matrix -- `data/homework5.h5ad` which contains cells from several healthy and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The primary cells in the matrix are cells from the peripheral immune system. Inspecting this, we might unravel how the immune system responds to infection. The H5AD format is built on top of HDF5 and is a standard within the gene-expression analysis ecosystem. You can easily load this data using `scanpy`, the standard single-cell data analysis toolkit in Python. Refer to the scanpy documentation for more information and see in particular `sc.read_h5ad`.\n",

    "Sequencing depth tells us how many reads of information we counted in our count matrix for a single cell. When comparing gene expression in cells with different sequencing depths, we must account for their total sum and normalize those counts. An easy but effective approach is to normalize expression counts in each cell, to sum up to a number. For single-cell RNAseq data, that number is 10,000. For bulk-RNAseq, that number is 1,000,000, and we know the unit as counts-per-million (CPM). There are more sophisticated methods for normalizing counts that account for mRNA lengths like TPM and other variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing the distribution of gene expression in different cells, we quickly see that they rarely follow a normal distribution but are heavily skewed. Therefore, we apply a logarithmic transformation to expression values. Using a natural logarithm is a standard procedure for RNAseq, whereas microarray data is already normal-like. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",

It can trigger various reactions, such as recruiting other cells, internal signaling to remove the virus, or cell death. We can observe gene expression in healthy cells to find genes with higher or lower expression in COVID-19 patient cells. We will perform differential expression (DE) to confirm their statistical significance.\n",

    "We will use a simple t-test for the differential expression. The test will give us a p-value for each gene, representing the probability that we will observe such or more extreme results if the null hypothesis is true. In practice, more sophisticated approaches are used, like Willcoxon rank-sum test. Also, some bulk-RNA methods are used in single-cell analysis, such as DESeq2. Sometimes, p-values can give a misleading impression. Therefore, we couple them with information about fold change (FC), calculated as the ratio of the mean expression. In essence, p-values tell us how significant the difference is, while fold change tells us how big the difference in expression is. Plotting $log_2(FC)$ on the x-axis and $-log_{10}(p_{values})$ on the y-axis gives us a volcano plot.\n",

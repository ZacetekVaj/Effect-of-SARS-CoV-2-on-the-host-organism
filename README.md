# Homework 5: Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the host organism

We will learn about the basics of gene expression data analysis. Biologists have found a way to measure how much each gene is *expressed* in each cell in an experiment. We do this by counting the number of mRNA molecules in each cell. Remember, DNA holds instructions for building proteins but can't be turned into proteins directly. Translation of DNA creates mRNA molecules which ribosomes read to synthesize proteins.
If we measure the amount of mRNA in a cell, we can tell what proteins the cell is making and, indirectly, what the cell is doing as a whole.
